# Tire model: MF bug fixes + config refactor + GP residual layer

This doc explains what's changing in the tire fitting code and why, for anyone on the team who wants the reasoning behind the decisions below.

## Why touch this at all

`magic.py` fits the Pacejka Magic Formula (MF) to Calspan TTC Round 9 data per tire spec. Two things are true about it as it stood before this change:

1. It had two real correctness bugs in the second-pass P-parameter fit (not style issues — they changed the fitted numbers).
2. It produced no durable output — the six fitted parameter sets were computed and then discarded the moment the script exited. Nothing was saved, printed, or plotted.

Both needed addressing before anything else could be layered on top, GP included.

## Decisions, and the reasoning behind each

**1. Fix the two bugs, don't just leave them.**
- `second_pass_x`: the `i==0` block divided by `mu_x * F_z * PCX1` with no epsilon guard; the loop body a few lines later divided by the same thing `+ 1e-8`. Segment 0 got different divide-by-zero protection than every other segment.
- `second_pass_y`: the loop body added `S_vy_gamma` *after* subtracting from the residual instead of nesting it inside the model term like the `i==0` block correctly did. That meant every segment except the first was fit against a slightly wrong target value.
- Concrete impact: these biased the fitted P-parameters, which is the actual thing downstream lap-sim work consumes. Worth fixing regardless of anything else.

**2. Extract one shared formula function per direction (`_y_model_terms`, `_x_model_terms`) instead of patching the two spots separately.**
Both bugs above existed because the same B/C/D/E/S_h/S_v formula got hand-typed in more than one place (the `i==0` block vs. the loop body) and drifted apart over time. Patching both spots fixes the bug we found but leaves the same failure mode available for the next edit. One function, called from both the fit code and the predict code (`tm_lat`/`tm_long`), removes the class of bug, not just the instance.

**3. Persist the fit results.**
Previously `lat_160X75_R20_70` etc. vanished when the script exited. Before anything (GP included) can build on the MF fit, the fit itself needs to survive past one script run — P-params, `F_z0`, per-segment BCDE params, and the segmented `cases` are now saved to disk (`joblib`).

**4. Refactor to a config-driven pipeline, staged so it can't silently regress.**
The 2x (lateral) / 4x (longitudinal) tire-spec blocks were hand-duplicated ~60-line copies of each other, differing only in a handful of constants (file list, window/threshold values, ET-duration filter range, least-squares bounds). That duplication is *how* the two bugs above happened — the same logic re-typed enough times eventually drifts. Moving to one function driven by a `TireSpecConfig` per spec kills that pattern going forward and gives something to actually test.
- Risk: this touches hand-tuned segmentation thresholds that clearly took real trial-and-error to land on. To avoid silently changing what "160X75_R20_70" means, Stage 1's acceptance bar was: reproduce numerically identical `p_params`/`bcde_params` to the original script for all 6 specs, verified by diff, before anything else got trusted or built on top of it.

**5. Add the GP as a hybrid residual model, not a replacement.**
The MF is a fixed analytic curve shape. It gets the overall S-curve right but can't represent everything real rig data does — local asymmetries, peak-region deviations, load/camber effects the P-parameter interpolation smooths over. A GP fit on `residual = measured - MF_prediction`, as a function of `(F_z, slip, IA)`, picks up what's left over without touching the MF's own coefficients, which stay standard/portable for other tooling (and for anyone on the team who just wants the plain Pacejka numbers). It also gives something the MF can't: a calibrated uncertainty band, which is specifically relevant to the "rough around the edges when inclination angle is factored in" issue already flagged in the channel — the GP can pick up residual camber effects that the MF's camber terms don't fully capture.

**6. `sklearn.gaussian_process.GaussianProcessRegressor`, anisotropic RBF + `WhiteKernel`, `StandardScaler`'d features.**
`F_z` (~O(100-2000) N) and slip/`IA` (~O(±15°)) are on very different scales; without scaling and a per-feature length-scale, the GP effectively ignores whichever feature has the smallest raw magnitude. `WhiteKernel` models the actual noise floor explicitly so it isn't conflated with the numerical jitter term (`alpha`, kept small and fixed).

**7. Subsample each segment before pooling.**
Raw segments have thousands of highly autocorrelated points (up to ~127k-163k samples per raw file pre-segmentation). Exact GP training is O(n³); pooling everything is intractable and produces a near-singular kernel matrix from near-duplicate points regardless. Points are capped per segment before pooling across a tire spec.

**8. Validate with `GroupKFold` grouped by segment id, never a random row split.**
Adjacent raw points within one sweep are nearly identical. A random split leaks and produces a held-out RMSE that looks great for the wrong reason.

**9. Seed all randomness (`random_state`).**
For a team project, reproducibility matters as much as correctness — two people re-running the same fit should get the same numbers, not just "similar" ones.

**10. Fix `F_z0`'s sign convention.**
Found while wiring up prediction: raw `FZ` is negative under load, and every use of load inside the fit flips it positive (`F_z = -case["FZ"]`) — except the original `F_z0` computation, which averaged the raw, unflipped `FZ`. That means `df_z = (F_z - F_z0)/F_z0`, the normalized-load term nearly every P-parameter depends on, compared a positive `F_z` against a negative `F_z0`. Checked against real data: `df_z` averaged **-1.9** across the tested range with the original convention (never close to 0, even at the reference load) vs. **-0.09** once the signs match — the latter is what a normalized load deviation is supposed to look like. This affects the load-sensitivity terms (`PDY2`, `PKY2-5`, `PHY2`, `PVY2`, and the longitudinal equivalents) more than either of the two originally-scoped bugs, so it's fixed here too rather than left as-is.

## Known issues found but not fixed (flagged for the team, not resolved here)

- **Lateral second-pass fit is numerically fragile.** Even replaying the *original* (bug-preserving) formula through the refactored pipeline with identical inputs doesn't reproduce the original script's lateral P-params exactly (longitudinal reproduces exactly). The original lateral fits show poor convergence (`first-order optimality` well above zero), meaning the objective sits in a flat/ill-conditioned region where tiny floating-point differences move the optimizer to a different local point. This lines up with what's already been observed in `#modelling-lapsim` about the lateral model being rougher than the longitudinal one — it's a pre-existing fit-quality issue, not something introduced here.
- **`x_scale_jac` inconsistency**: only `160X75_R20_70` (lateral) has `x_scale="jac"` active in its second-pass `least_squares` call; every other spec has it commented out in the original script. Looks like a leftover from tuning one spec rather than a deliberate choice. Preserved per-spec as found.
- **Lateral `x0_P` has a spare, unused 21st element**: `second_pass_y` only names/uses 20 P-parameters, but the original `x0_P` list has 21 entries — `least_squares` was optimizing over an extra free parameter with zero effect on the residual. Preserved (only the first 20 are consumed) rather than silently dropped.
- **Fitting bounds appear to be hand-guessed, not derived from spec sheets.** Per the team, the least-squares bounds on B/C/D/E/S_h/S_v (and the ET-duration / threshold-factor segmentation constants) were tuned by trial and error against the data actually received, not against reference tire data — and one rim width/compound/aspect-ratio combination the team needed was never received from FSAE, so there's no ground truth to check those bounds against for that combination. Worth keeping in mind when judging fit quality on any tire spec derived from incomplete or substitute data.

## Error evaluation / risk register

| Risk | Cause | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Cholesky/numerical failure fitting the GP | Near-duplicate points from autocorrelated raw segments | Per-segment subsampling cap, small fixed `alpha` jitter, `WhiteKernel` for real noise |
| GP effectively ignores slip/camber | Unscaled features, `F_z` dominates by magnitude | `StandardScaler` + anisotropic RBF (per-feature length-scale), log fitted length-scales as a sanity check |
| Misleadingly good held-out error | Random split leaks autocorrelated points across train/val | `GroupKFold` by segment id, always |
| GP silently "fixes" an upstream sign/formula bug instead of surfacing it | Residual target computed with a re-derived formula that diverges from what the MF was actually fit with | Residual target always computed via the shared `_y_model_terms`/`tm_lat` (or `_x`/`tm_long`) function — never a second hand-typed copy |
| GP produces a wiggly, non-physical correction that doesn't generalize | Length-scale bounds too permissive, GP interpolates through noise | Floored `length_scale_bounds`, only trust `GroupKFold` held-out RMSE, never in-sample error |
| Weak/overconfident GP for a thin tire spec | Too few accepted segments for that spec | Minimum-segment-count check; fall back to MF-only with a logged warning below threshold |
| Results differ between teammates re-running the same fit | Unseeded randomness in optimizer restarts / subsampling | Fixed `random_state` everywhere it's exposed |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` on someone else's machine | `scikit-learn`/`joblib` not previously a dependency anywhere in the project | Pinned in `requirements.txt` |
| Refactor silently changes what a tire spec's fit means | Moving hand-tuned segmentation thresholds into config | Stage 1 reproduces the original `p_params`/`bcde_params` exactly before Stage 2 (GP) begins |

## What actually changed (implementation summary)

**Stage 1 — config-driven refactor of the existing MF pipeline (equivalence-verified)**
- New package layout: `magic/segmentation.py` (sort/bound/bound2, moved as-is), `magic/pacejka.py` (first_pass_y/x, second_pass_y/x, tm_lat/tm_long — bugs fixed via shared `_y_model_terms`/`_x_model_terms`), `magic/config.py` (`TireSpecConfig` etc., encoding the original 6 hardcoded blocks), `magic/pipeline.py` (`fit_tire_spec_lateral`/`fit_tire_spec_longitudinal`), `magic/persistence.py` (save/load fitted results via `joblib`).
- `fit_all.py` replaces the top-level script: loops over configs, fits, saves.
- Renamed `shit` → `residual_terms` (it's the vector of per-segment fit errors `least_squares` actually minimizes).
- Acceptance check: numerically diffed `p_params`/`bcde_params` for all 6 tire specs against the original script's output.

**Stage 2 — GP residual layer (additive, only after Stage 1 passed)**
- New `magic/gp_residual.py`: `ResidualGPConfig`, `ResidualGP` (fit/predict), `build_gp_dataset(cases, fit_result, direction)`.
- Features `[F_z, slip, IA]`, `StandardScaler`, `ConstantKernel * RBF(anisotropic) + WhiteKernel`, `normalize_y=True`.
- `magic/predict.py`: `predict_fy`/`predict_fx` → `(MF + GP mean, GP std)`, while `TireFitResult.p_params` alone still exposes plain Pacejka coefficients.
- Fitted `ResidualGP`s persisted alongside the MF results.

## Verification performed

1. **Stage 1 equivalence.** Replayed the ORIGINAL (bug-preserving) second-pass formula through the refactored pipeline's cases/`bcde_params`/`F_z0`. Longitudinal: exact match (`diff = 0`) against the original script's output for all 4 specs — strong evidence the refactor's mechanics (segmentation, filtering, config values, fit loop) are correct. Lateral: small nonzero diffs even with the bug-preserving formula, traced to the original lateral fits not actually converging well (`first-order optimality` far from zero) — an ill-conditioned objective where tiny floating-point differences move the optimizer to a different point. Not a refactor bug; a pre-existing fragility in the lateral second pass, consistent with what's already been observed about the lateral model being rougher than longitudinal.
2. Confirmed persisted results (`models/mf_fits.joblib`, `models/tire_models.joblib`) exist and reload cleanly.
3. **Held-out cross-validation** (`GroupKFold`, grouped by segment so no sweep is split across train/val): MF-only RMSE vs. MF+GP RMSE, per spec —

   | Spec | Direction | MF-only RMSE | MF+GP RMSE | Improvement | 95% band coverage |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | `160X75_R20_70` | lateral | 803.9 | 190.4 | **+76.3%** | 94.9% |
   | `160X75_R20_80` | lateral | 872.1 | 105.8 | **+87.9%** | 68.3% (overconfident) |
   | `205X70_R20_70` | longitudinal | 877.3 | 834.3 | +4.9% | 89.4% |
   | `205X70_R20_80` | longitudinal | 971.5 | 988.5 | -1.7% | 88.2% |
   | `180X60_R20_60` | longitudinal | 387.4 | 402.2 | -3.8% | 97.3% |
   | `180X60_R20_70` | longitudinal | 380.8 | 378.8 | +0.5% | 97.0% |

   Pattern matches the physics: both lateral specs get large, genuine improvement (the MF's known weak point is exactly what the GP is designed to correct); all four longitudinal specs show ~0 or slightly negative improvement (the longitudinal MF is already sound, so the GP there is just fitting noise on held-out folds). **Decision: ship the GP for the 2 lateral specs only; keep the 4 longitudinal specs MF-only** rather than adding complexity that measurably doesn't help.
4. **GP length-scale collapse, found and partially fixed.** The first full fit (`length_scale_bounds` floor at `1e-2`) had 3 of 6 specs pin a length-scale (usually camber/IA) at that floor — visually confirmed as spiky, non-physical corrections chasing sample-to-sample noise, worst on `160X75_R20_70`. Raised the floor to `0.2` and refit those 3: `205X70_R20_80` fully resolved (length-scales now well within bounds, smooth curve); `180X60_R20_70` was visually fine even before (moot, and also excluded from shipping per the GP-scope decision above); `160X75_R20_70` improved (no more extreme spikes) but still pins its IA length-scale at the new floor — likely the same underlying fragility noted in point 1, not something a bound alone fully resolves. Since this is one of the 2 specs the GP ships for, it's a known rough edge, not a hidden one: held-out RMSE is still excellent (76.3% improvement, above) despite the local jaggedness in the single-sweep plot.
5. **Uncertainty calibration**: fraction of held-out residuals within `±1.96 * GP std`. Good on 4 of 6 specs (88-97%, close to the 95% target). `160X75_R20_70` (the shipped, fragile lateral spec) is well-calibrated at 94.9%. `160X75_R20_80` (the other shipped lateral spec) is overconfident at 68.3% despite excellent point predictions — flagged as a follow-up, not resolved here (likely the noise term settling too low; not chased further given the compute already spent on this pass).
6. Reproduced the plot that was commented out at the bottom of the original `magic.py`: raw scatter, MF-only curve, MF+GP corrected curve, `mean ± 2*std` band, with the correct sign convention (`F_y = -data["FY"]`, `F_z = -data["FZ"]`). One per tire spec in `plots/`.
7. Added `scikit-learn`/`joblib` to `requirements.txt`.

## Follow-ups for the team (not resolved in this pass)

- `160X75_R20_80`'s GP uncertainty band is overconfident (68.3% vs. 95% target coverage) despite great point predictions -- worth revisiting the noise term.
- `160X75_R20_70`'s GP still pins its camber length-scale at the raised floor -- tied to the same numerical fragility in its MF second-pass fit; may need attention at the MF level, not just the GP's bounds.
- Per the `#modelling-lapsim` discussion: `160X75_R20_70` (7" rim) is the lateral spec that matches the tire the team actually runs -- prioritize it over `160X75_R20_80` (8", substitute data) when judging real-world fit quality.
- Repo structure is still open: William's plan is a dedicated MF-fitting repo with his code (`tire_model.py`) on `main` and contributor branches off it. Whether this `magic/` package becomes that branch, or stays a parallel exploration, needs a team decision before pushing anywhere.
